        <p>The Hollow Knight map is obviously an iconic part of the game and most players know about the many landmarks and sites throughout the map.
             Hollow Knight also has 14 Biomes or areas which range from The Forgotten Crossroads, to The Ancient Basin, and The City of Tears</p>
        <p>This Hollow Knight map is an official art work made by Team Cherry which is missing some parts of the map like The Abyss. The image below
             will show the Hollow Knight how it is shown in game with all areas (With no markers).</p>

        Transformed Areas
    </h1>

    <div class="transform1">
        <p id="infectpara">In Hollow Knight several areas change as the player progresses through the game due to the spread
             of the infection or due to other factors not relevant. The most notable of these changes is the
              Forgotten Crossroads to the Infected crossroads. This change causes the Forgotten Crossroads to be overcome with
               infection, it also affects the enemies as they become overriden with infection and become deadlier and more hostile.</p>

        <p id="mapara">To get Maps of Hallownest you must interact with the NPC Cornifer. He will let you purchase a map
             of whatever location you find him in for a certain amount of geo. You can identify Cornifer is near by his distinct hum.</p>

    <p>Some things that you'll need along the journey are a Map and Quill and the Wayward Compass.
         The Map and Quill is what updates your map to do this you must sit on a bench after roaming
          around a new area to see it in your map. The Wayward Compass is a Charm that you can equip
           to see where you are on the map, it shows up as a little icon of the Knight. You can purchase
            both of these with Geo at Iseldas shop in Dirtmouth whom is actually Cornifers wife! How cute.</p>

    <p>The map of Hallownest is very diverse and there are many things to find and many places to explore truly a place to get lost in for hours on end and keeps the player on its feet completing task after task. Dont forget there are secret passages not shown on the map so Good Luck finding them!

            <p id="footerp">Hollow Knight is being developed by Team Cherry in Adelaide, South Australia. We're a team of 3 people who, alongside making the game, are responsible for building these websites,
                 cutting those game trailers, posting regular game updates, answering questions on social media and much more. Though it's a lot of work, we love doing it, and it's made even more
                  enjoyable by the enthusiastic support we've received from fans this whole way.</p>
