        <p>The Hollow Knight map is obviously an iconic part of the game and most players know about the many landmarks and sites throughout the map.
             Hollow Knight also has 14 Biomes or areas which range from The Forgotten Crossroads, to The Ancient Basin, and The City of Tears</p>
        <p>This Hollow Knight map is an official art work made by Team Cherry which is missing some parts of the map like The Abyss. The image below
             will show the Hollow Knight how it is shown in game with all areas (With no markers).</p>

        Transformed Areas
    </h1>

    <div class="transform1">
        <p id="infectpara">In Hollow Knight several areas change as the player progresses through the game due to the spread
             of the infection or due to other factors not relevant. The most notable of these changes is the
              Forgotten Crossroads to the Infected crossroads. This change causes the Forgotten Crossroads to be overcome with
               infection, it also affects the enemies as they become overriden with infection and become deadlier and more hostile.</p>
